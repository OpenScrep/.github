OpenScrep is an initiative dedicated to developing small open-source projects, aiming to promote knowledge sharing and collaboration among developers. The organization focuses on creating simple and efficient solutions that can be useful to the community, encouraging best development practices and the adoption of modern technologies.

With a strong emphasis on open-source projects, OpenScrep seeks to contribute with tools and solutions that can assist other developers in their work. The initiative is open to contributions from anyone interested in collaborating, whether through code, documentation, or innovative ideas.

The name "OpenScrep" was chosen to reflect its purpose: working on small and simple projects that others might see as insignificant or disposable, but which have the potential to be valuable and impactful. What some might consider scraps, we see as opportunities for innovation and creativity.
